Phew! Our new website is out of the oven.<br><br>

Our previous web site, built (likewise) with blood, sweat and tears, had served us until now for roughly five years, with minor updates and additions every now and then. It was built with technologies that were still back then if not state-of-the-art, at least somewhat acceptable – mainly [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).<br><br>

We have never really been satisfied with out-of-the-shelf CMS web site solutions and generators (our fault, probably), because we are perfectionists and want to have a lot of control over every aspect, under the hood, without excess overhead. Therefore, we sought long for a new solution that would serve our purposes, but be at least somewhat easier to maintain, since in the previous company pages, it was all hand-crafted by artisanal programming.<br><br>

Finally we decided to have a bit of a learning curve included in building the sites and try something we had had our eyes on for longer – [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps, especially used to create blazing fast server-side rendered progressive web apps and static web pages. So, [React](https://reactjs.org/), Gatsby, and added a bit [Material-Ui](https://material-ui.com/) in the mix. For site management we decided to try headless [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) -based CMS on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), from which content is served via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).<br><br>

Time will show if our choice was good. But at least now we’re liking it, a lot. Are you? It is indeed blazing fast, and we haven’t even added all possible optimizations yet. And there are quite a bit of new things to come up. Stay tuned!
